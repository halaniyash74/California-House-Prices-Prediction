# California House Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the price of houses in California using the California Housing dataset from Scikit-learn.

## Libraries Used:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models and preprocessing.

## Approach:
1. Load the California Housing dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. Preprocess the data by scaling features and splitting the data into training and test sets.
4. Build and train a linear regression model.
5. Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.
6. Visualize the predictions versus actual prices.

## Model:
- Linear Regression was used to predict house prices.

## Results:
- The model's R-squared score and other evaluation metrics were calculated to evaluate the prediction accuracy.
